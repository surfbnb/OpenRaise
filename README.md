# [ROADMAP](https://github.com/dOrgTech/OpenRaise/blob/master/docs/Roadmap.md)

> A Toolkit for accountable on-chain fundraising, and being developed through a collaboration by [dOrg](https://dorg.tech/#/) and [Level K](https://www.levelk.io/). [DXdao](https://dxdao.daostack.io/) commissioned them to develop its fundraiser dapp using [@FairmintCO](https://twitter.com/FairmintCO) smart contracts. DXdao recently ratified the configuration parameters, including pre-mint, curve slope, dividend split, and kickstarter threshold.

# OpenRaise

> "Accountable fundraising for the next generation of decentralized organizations"

⚠️ These contracts are in beta and have not been audited, do not use these contracts in production.

Blockchain, and Ethereum in particular, promises to reshape capital formation. However, the ICO craze of 2017 demonstrated the need for accountability, giving rise to new models for fundraising such as Continuous Organizations and DAICOs. Open Raise is a modular library of smart contracts and UI components that bring these ideas to life and make it easy for organizations to run accountable fundraising campaigns. The first release will support curve bonded token sales with self-enforcing dividend claims. The roadmap (see below) consists of adding DAICO support and modularizing the code before integrating with popular DAO frameworks and supporting additional functionality.
